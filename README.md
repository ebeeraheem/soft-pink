# SOFTY PINKO

## Business Strategy

This is my second attempt at responsive design. I can tell you it's much better than my first take.

Here's a link to view the site: [Softy Pinko](https://ebeeraheem.github.io/soft-pink/)

## Some things to take note:

- I used way too many `em`s than necessary
- Setting the width of the name and email fields to 50% each makes them overflow. I have no idea why.
- As at 3:15 pm 31st Oct, 2023, the menu icon does not work as I am yet to implement the JS logic required to do that.
- The width on the Pricing Plan cards is also a mystery to me as of yet.
- The icons on the footer also overflow in FireFox Desktop browser but works fine on Chrome and Edge.

I'm not sure how but if you can help resolve any of the afforementioned issues please do let me know.
